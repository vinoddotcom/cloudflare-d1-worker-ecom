## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Structure

The API follows a RESTful design pattern with the following structure:

- Public endpoints: `/api/v1/[resource]` (accessible without authentication)
- User endpoints: `/api/v1/[resource]` (requires user authentication)
- Admin endpoints: `/api/v1/admin/[resource]` (requires admin role)

### Authentication & Authorization

- Authentication is implemented using Firebase Authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control is implemented through middleware
- Supports three roles: customer, manager, and admin

### Database Schema

The database schema is enterprise-grade with:

- Proper relationships between entities (foreign keys)
- Appropriate constraints for data integrity
- Well-designed tables for each core business entity
- Support for complex queries and operations

## Known Issues

There are some TypeScript errors in the repository implementations:

1. Type mismatches between repository methods and their base classes
2. Missing properties or incorrect typings in some model objects
3. Inconsistency in naming conventions (camelCase vs snake_case)

## Next Steps

### Short Term

- Fix TypeScript type errors in repository implementations
- Enhance error handling across all controllers
- Add comprehensive input validation for admin APIs

### Medium Term

- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Add filtering and sorting options to list endpoints
- Complete invoice generation functionality

### Long Term

- Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Set up monitoring and observability
- Implement automated testing for all endpoints
